# Government Efficiency Tracker

The **Government Efficiency Tracker** is an open-source, crowdsourced project that aims to track U.S. government agencies and their spending. The goal is to ensure transparency and the wise use of tax dollars, allowing anyone to contribute to or analyze the data. This project is in no way affliated with or sponsored by the U.S. government. This is simply a project to leverage the great set of data available as a result of the DATA act signed into law in 2014. 

## Project Overview

Government spending can often be difficult to track and understand. This project collects, organizes, and analyzes data on U.S. federal agencies, providing a transparent view of how tax dollars are allocated. Through the power of community contributions, the aim is to provide accurate, up-to-date information to the public.

## Features

I am hoping that the result of this project will help with the below items:

- **Data Collection**: Track spending of various U.S. government agencies in real time.
- **Visualization**: Display agency budgets and spending trends with easy-to-understand graphs.
- **Collaboration**: Anyone can contribute data or analysis tools to the project.
- **Efficiency Ratings**: Analyze which agencies are using tax dollars most efficiently.
- **Open Data Access**: All data collected is freely accessible and reusable.
